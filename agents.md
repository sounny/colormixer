# Agents & Contribution Log

## Project Overview
**Color Mixer** is an interactive educational web app that demonstrates the difference between **subtractive color mixing** (paint/pigments using RYB) and **additive color mixing** (light using RGB). Users can toggle between modes and mix primary colors to see resulting secondary colors.

### Key Features
- **Paint Mode (RYB)**: Red + Yellow = Orange, Red + Blue = Purple, Yellow + Blue = Green, All = Brown
- **Light Mode (RGB)**: Red + Green = Yellow, Red + Blue = Magenta, Green + Blue = Cyan, All = White
- Mode switching with full theme change (light/dark)
- Animated result blob with glow effects (Light mode) and shine effects (Paint mode)
- Responsive design with modern aesthetics

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Only** - No backend required
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No frameworks, no build step
- **Google Fonts** - Inter font family
- **Custom SVG Icons** - Palette (Paint mode) & Zap (Light mode)

## Agent Talk

### 🧭 Menu Space Improvement Brainstorm (OpenAI Codex, GPT-5.2)
**Goal**: Reduce menu height/visual weight while keeping key actions discoverable.

#### ✅ Layout & Density Ideas
- **Collapsible groups**: Fold secondary controls (Print, Export, Learn) into a "Teacher Tools" accordion.
- **Segmented tabs**: Replace vertical lists with tabs (e.g., "Mix", "Explore", "Tools").
- **Two-row grid**: Convert long toolbars into a compact 2-row grid for desktop widths.
- **Overflow menu**: Keep only primary actions visible; move extra items into a ⋯ overflow menu.
- **Icon-first buttons**: Use icons with optional labels on hover or in expanded view.

#### 📱 Responsive/Mobile Adjustments
- **Responsive shrink**: Auto-collapse labels to icons when viewport < 900px.
- **Sticky bottom sheet**: Place infrequent controls in a slide-up panel on mobile.
- **Compact density toggle**: Let users switch to a "compact UI" mode.

#### 🧩 Visual/Hierarchy Tweaks
- **Priority ordering**: Reorder actions by frequency; demote rarely-used buttons to secondary styling.
- **Inline toggles**: Combine small toggles into a single "Settings" popover.
- **Contextual actions**: Show Print/Export only when modal is open or when relevant.
