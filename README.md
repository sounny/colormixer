# 🎨 Color Mixer

An interactive, educational web application designed to demonstrate the fascinating science of color mixing. Whether you're exploring the world of physical pigments (RYB) or the physics of light (RGB), Color Mixer provides a hands-on, accessible, and gamified learning experience.

## 🚀 Vision

Color Mixer was built with a **child-first, accessibility-focused** philosophy. Originally inspired by Dr. Sounny for his own children, it has evolved into a robust tool suitable for students of all ages. Our goal is to transform abstract color theory into an engaging discovery journey.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dual Mixing Models**: Switch between **Subtractive (Paint/RYB)** and **Additive (Light/RGB)** modes.
- **Challenge Mode**: Test your knowledge with progressive difficulty levels (Easy to Expert).
- **Guided Learning Path**: A 9-step interactive course through the fundamentals of color theory.
- **Achievement System**: Earn badges as you discover new colors and master challenges.
- **Top-Tier Accessibility**:
  - High-contrast patterns for users with color vision deficiencies.
  - Full keyboard navigation.
  - Screen reader (ARIA) optimization.
  - High Contrast Mode for improved legibility.
  - Reduced Motion support.
- **Classroom Ready**:
  - **PWA Support**: Install it on any device and use it offline.
  - **Embed Mode**: Link directly to specific color configurations for lessons.
  - **Sound Feedback**: Satisfying audio cues for a tactile feel (can be muted).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No frameworks, no build steps—just fast, clean code.
- **Web Audio API**: Real-time synthesized sound effects.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Service Worker integration for offline reliability.
- **SVG Patterns**: Dynamic accessibility overlays.

## 🤖 AI Agent Collaboration

This project is a unique demonstration of **multi-agent AI collaboration**. Over 48 hours, a team of specialized AI agents coordinated to build, refactor, and polish this application:

- **Gemini CLI**: Architect, pedagogical lead, and documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Feature developer and UX polish.
- **OpenAI Codex**: Accessibility research and pattern design.
- **CLI 2 (Gemini)**: Infrastructure and persistence.
- **Antigravity**: Project management, roadmap coordination, and pedagogy research.
- **Devstral-2**: Performance optimization and PWA lead.
- **Axiom Vale / Jules**: External evaluation, bug fixing, and strategic audit.
