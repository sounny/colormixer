# Product Guide

## 1. Vision Statement
To create an engaging and accessible educational web application that empowers K-12 students and undergraduates to intuitively explore and master color theory through interactive experimentation. By visualizing the distinct mechanics of additive and subtractive mixing, the app serves as a versatile tool for discovery, creativity, and foundational art and science education.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Elementary school students (Age-appropriate, playful interface).
*   **Secondary:** K-12 students and Undergraduates (Depth for advanced exploration).
*   **Educators:** Teachers looking for interactive classroom aids.

## 3. Core Value Proposition
*   **Unified Learning:** Seamlessly bridges the gap between digital (light) and physical (pigment) color interactions.
*   **Interactive Discovery:** Transforms abstract theory into immediate visual feedback.
*   **Accessible Design:** Ensures usability for diverse learners, including those with color vision deficiencies.

## 4. Key Educational Goals
*   **Foundational Mechanics:** Clearly differentiate between Additive (RGB/Light) and Subtractive (RYB/Paint) color mixing systems.
*   **Advanced Concepts:** Introduce and visualize Secondary and Tertiary color formation.
*   **Psychology & Emotion:** Explore the emotional and psychological impact of colors in design and art.
*   **Measurable Outcomes:** Provide challenges or quizzes to validate learning (e.g., "Make Green").

## 5. Key Features
*   **Dual-Mode Mixer:** One-click toggle between Paint (RYB) and Light (RGB) modes.
*   **Interactive Canvas:** Visual "blob" or canvas that reacts instantly to color inputs.
*   **Challenge Mode:** Gamified prompts to encourage active learning.
*   **Contextual Education:** Tooltips or pop-ups explaining the *why* behind the mix.

## 6. Project Collaboration & Agents
*   **Agent Roles:** The development process explicitly integrates multiple AI agents (Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex) to simulate a diverse engineering team.
*   **Agent Coordination:** Features and code quality are maintained through collaborative review and specific agent assignments (e.g., Accessibility implementation, Test coverage).
