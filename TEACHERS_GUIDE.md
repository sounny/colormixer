# Teacher's Guide: Color Mixer

Welcome to the **Color Mixer** educational tool! This app is designed to help students discover the fundamentals of color theory through hands-on experimentation. This guide provides lesson plans, discussion questions, and pedagogical strategies to maximize the learning impact in your classroom.

## 🎨 Learning Objectives

By using Color Mixer, students will be able to:
1.  **Differentiate** between **Subtractive (Paint/RYB)** and **Additive (Light/RGB)** color models.
2.  **Identify** Primary colors for both models.
3.  **Predict** the resulting Secondary colors when mixing two Primaries.
4.  **Understand** why mixing all paint colors results in dark colors (absorption) while mixing all light colors results in white (emission).

## 🏫 Lesson Plans

### 1. Hands-On Discovery (Grades K-2)
**Goal**: Identify primary and secondary paint colors.
*   **Activity**: Open the app in **Paint (RYB)** mode. Ask students to click each color one by one. Then, ask them to find three different ways to make a "new" color using only two clicks.
*   **Challenge**: Use the **Challenge Mode** (Game icon) and see who can reach "Level 2" first!
*   **Discussion**: "Which mix was your favorite? Does mixing more colors make the result lighter or darker?"

### 2. The Science of Light (Grades 3-5)
**Goal**: Explore the RGB model and compare it to paint.
*   **Activity**: Switch to **Light (RGB)** mode. Ask students to mix Red and Green. Many will expect Brown or Orange (like paint), but they will discover **Yellow**.
*   **Comparison**: Have students make "Yellow" in both Paint and Light modes. Discuss the difference in the "ingredients" needed.
*   **Deep Dive**: Use the **"Learn Why"** tooltips to read the scientific explanations for each mix.

### 3. Color Expert Challenge (Grades 6-8)
**Goal**: Master the relationship between all color combinations.
*   **Activity**: Start the **Learning Path** (Book icon). Have students complete the entire 9-step guided sequence.
*   **Project**: Ask students to find a real-world object (e.g., a blade of grass, a sunset) and recreate that color in the app using both modes if possible.
*   **Outcome**: Students should be able to explain why a computer screen (RGB) uses different primaries than a desktop printer (CMYK/RYB concepts).

## 💡 Pedagogical Tips

*   **Scaffolding**: Encourage younger students to start with the **Learning Path**. It provides step-by-step instructions that "fade" as they gain confidence.
*   **Gamification**: Use the **Achievement System** to motivate students. Ask them to "Unlock the Color Expert badge" as a homework or in-class goal.
*   **Offline Use**: Since this is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, you can "install" it on tablets or laptops. Once loaded, it works perfectly without an internet connection—ideal for field trips or classrooms with spotty Wi-Fi.

## ❓ Discussion Starters

1.  "In Paint mode, why does adding more colors make the result look like mud (Brown)?"
2.  "If you mix all the colors in Light mode, why do we get White instead of Black?"
3.  "Why do you think your TV uses Red, Green, and Blue, but your art class uses Red, Yellow, and Blue?"
4.  "What was the hardest achievement to unlock? Why?"

## 🛠️ Tech for Teachers

*   **Embed Mode**: You can link directly to specific color mixes for your presentations.
    *   Example: `index.html?mode=RGB&colors=red,green` will open the app with Yellow light pre-mixed.
*   **Accessibility**: If you have students with color vision deficiencies, encourage them to toggle **Accessibility Mode** (Eye icon). It adds high-contrast patterns to the colors to make them distinguishable without relying on hue.
